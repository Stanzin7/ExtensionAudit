I have the Codebase in other private Repo, I am making some of it Open source.
I have used ThreatXtension as the first layer, refernce should be below.
And then built extensive rulesets on top of that.

I am using AI to streamline and move files across, please check after two days,
so I can fix the pipeline; ideally I am thinking to hook this frontend to threatXtension 
engine which is running in background, and rulesets so anyone can play around and suggest fixes.
